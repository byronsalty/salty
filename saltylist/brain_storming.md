SaltyList was conceived of as a way to manage the autogeneration of daily todo lists. 

It's undetermined if it will also handle the management and checking off of lists as well, or simplying the creation of the templates.

- Item. Something that is in a check list. 
- Day of Week Item. Ex: Every Monday do ...
- Day of Month Item. Ex: First of Month do ...

Any other types to consider?
